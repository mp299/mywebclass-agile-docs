# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
"As a teacher at MyWebClass and a website user, I want to have a seamless experience while using the website, trust that my personal data is protected in accordance with GDPR regulations, and incorporate Agile methodologies in teaching modern software development technologies to provide students with a hands-on learning experience. By following Agile principles, we can quickly and effectively deliver project outcomes for our initiatives, which include creating a website that follows proper Search Engine Optimization and Google Analytics Integration, with a clean and simple design for ease of use. This approach contextualizes technology with business processes, enabling our students to learn in a realistic and practical environment, preparing them for success in the tech industry."

## Test plan

Use a tool like Selenium to perform end-to-end testing of the website's features, such as the search function and user registration process.
Use a tool like JMeter to test the website's performance under heavy traffic.
Use a tool like Jenkins to automate the deployment process and ensure that the website is deployed correctly.
Use a tool like SonarQube to perform code analysis and identify any code quality issues.
Use a tool like Postman to test the website's APIs and ensure that they are functioning correctly.
Use a tool like BrowserStack to test the website on multiple browsers and devices to ensure that it is responsive and user-friendly across different platforms.
